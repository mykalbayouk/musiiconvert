# MusiiConvert

MusiiConvert is a tool designed to convert music files from one format to another. It supports a variety of audio formats and provides an easy-to-use interface for seamless conversion.

## Issue

Unfortunately, one of the main libraries (webmcore) is outdated and has issues with being launched in production mode. This is currently an ongoing issue but for now, this only works locally on your machine. I am looking into other libraries or rebuilding them from scratch in the meantime.

## Features

- Convert between multiple audio formats (e.g., MP3, WAV, FLAC, AAC)
- Batch conversion for multiple files
- High-quality audio output
- User-friendly interface
